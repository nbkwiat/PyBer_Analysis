# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use the data provided by PyBer ride sharing company to analyze the fares between the different kinds of city environments.

## Results

### Total Rides
Looking at the data summary above we can see that urban settings such as large cities have the most amount of ride shares. This is probably due to a high population density.

### Total Drivers
We can also see from the data summary that urban settings have the highest number of drivers as well. This is probably to keep up with demand.

### Total Fares
The interesting thing about the total number of fares is that urban settings had the highest total even though they had the lowest average fare price. I believe this is the case because being in the city setting there isnt a huge amount of distance needed to travel resulting in lower fares. 

### Average Fare per Driver and Ride
As far as averages go, it is more than clear that rural settings have the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. This is most likely due to the lower amount of drivers and a larger distance required to travel. Both of those things would equate to higher fare prices. 


### Total Fares by City Type

Looking at the data above, it is clear that the urban setting has the highest total fares by city type. Whats interesting is that they all follow a similar patern with their peaks and valleys all occuring at about the same spots. it looks like closer to the beginning of the year the fares start of slow and then really pick up later in March and towards April. We can infer that this is probably due to weather changes or possibly events going on during those months.

## Summary
From this analysis I have three recommendations to the CEO of PyBer to address the disparities between the diffent settings.
  - To combat the rural ride rate, fare prices should be a little lower to encourage ride sharing.
  - In the suburban setting an increase of drivers might help bring up the numbers a little bit.
  - Running ride share specials during the beginning of the year might provide people with another reason to ride share instead of drive during the cold periods.
